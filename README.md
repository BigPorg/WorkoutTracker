## Considerations

Getting into noSQL content was interesting but tricky. There were issues with connectivity between my routes and the page itself but with some help I believe I managed to figure it out. Working with Mongoose was interesting, it is weird to think that Mongosh is always running. Aggregate proved a bit frustrating.
